socket.io
=========

#### Sockets for the rest of us

The `socket.io` client is basically a simple HTTP Socket interface implementation.
It looks similar to WebSocket while providing additional features and
leveraging other transports when WebSocket is not supported by the user's
browser.

```js
var socket = io.connect('http://domain.com');
socket.on('connect', function () {
  // socket connected
});
socket.on('custom event', function () {
  // server emitted a custom event
});
socket.on('disconnect', function () {
  // socket disconnected
});
socket.send('hi there');
```

### Recipes

#### Utilizing namespaces (ie: multiple sockets)

If you want to namespace all the messages and events emitted to a particular
endpoint, simply specify it as part of the `connect` uri:

```js
var chat = io.connect('http://localhost/chat');
chat.on('connect', function () {
  // chat socket connected
});

var news = io.connect('/news'); // io.connect auto-detects host
news.on('connect', function () {
  // news socket connected
});
```

#### Emitting custom events

To ease with the creation of applications, you can emit custom events outside
of the global `message` event.

```js
var socket = io.connect();
socket.emit('server custom event', { my: 'data' });
```

#### Forcing disconnection

```js
var socket = io.connect();
socket.on('connect', function () {
  socket.disconnect();
});
```

### Documentation 

#### io#connect

```js
io.connect(uri, [options]);
```

##### Options:

- *resource*

    socket.io

  The resource is what allows the `socket.io` server to identify incoming connections by `socket.io` clients. In other words, any HTTP server can implement socket.io and still serve other normal, non-realtime HTTP requests.

- *transports*

```js
['websocket', 'flashsocket', 'htmlfile', 'xhr-multipart', 'xhr-polling', 'jsonp-polling']
```

  A list of the transports to attempt to utilize (in order of preference).

- *'connect timeout'*

```js
5000
```

  The amount of milliseconds a transport has to create a connection before we consider it timed out.
  
- *'try multiple transports'*

```js
true
```

  A boolean indicating if we should try other transports when the  connectTimeout occurs.
  
- *reconnect*

```js
true
```

  A boolean indicating if we should automatically reconnect if a connection is disconnected. 
  
- *'reconnection delay'*

```js
500
```

  The amount of milliseconds before we try to connect to the server again. We are using a exponential back off algorithm for the following reconnections, on each reconnect attempt this value will get multiplied (500 > 1000 > 2000 > 4000 > 8000).
  

- *'max reconnection attempts'*

```js
10
```

  The amount of attempts should we make using the current transport to connect to the server? After this we will do one final attempt, and re-try with all enabled transport methods before we give up.

##### Properties:

- *options*

  The passed in options combined with the defaults.

- *connected*

  Whether the socket is connected or not.
  
- *connecting*

  Whether the socket is connecting or not.

- *reconnecting*

  Whether we are reconnecting or not.
  
- *transport*  

  The transport instance.

##### Methods:
  
- *connect(λ)*

  Establishes a connection. If λ is supplied as argument, it will be called once the connection is established.
  
- *send(message)*
  
  A string of data to send.
  
- *disconnect*

  Closes the connection.
  
- *on(event, λ)*

  Adds a listener for the event *event*.

- *once(event, λ)*

  Adds a one time listener for the event *event*. The listener is removed after the first time the event is fired.
  
- *removeListener(event, λ)*

  Removes the listener λ for the event *event*.
  
##### Events:

- *connect*

  Fired when the connection is established and the handshake successful.
  
- *connecting(transport_type)*

    Fired when a connection is attempted, passing the transport name.
  
- *connect_failed*

    Fired when the connection timeout occurs after the last connection attempt.
  This only fires if the `connectTimeout` option is set.
  If the `tryTransportsOnConnectTimeout` option is set, this only fires once all
  possible transports have been tried.
  
- *message(message)*
  
  Fired when a message arrives from the server

- *close*

  Fired when the connection is closed. Be careful with using this event, as some transports will fire it even under temporary, expected disconnections (such as XHR-Polling).
  
- *disconnect*

  Fired when the connection is considered disconnected.
  
- *reconnect(transport_type,reconnectionAttempts)*

  Fired when the connection has been re-established. This only fires if the `reconnect` option is set.

- *reconnecting(reconnectionDelay,reconnectionAttempts)*

  Fired when a reconnection is attempted, passing the next delay for the next reconnection.

- *reconnect_failed*

  Fired when all reconnection attempts have failed and we where unsuccessful in reconnecting to the server.

# socket.io-client

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/socket.io-client.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/socket.io-client)
![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/socket.io-client.svg)
![Downloads](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/socket.io-client.svg?style=flat)

## How to use

A standalone build of `socket.io-client` is exposed automatically by the
socket.io server as `/socket.io/socket.io.js`. Alternatively you can
serve the file `socket.io.js` found at the root of this repository.

```html
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io('http://localhost');
  socket.on('connect', function(){});
  socket.on('event', function(data){});
  socket.on('disconnect', function(){});
</script>
```

Socket.IO is compatible with [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

### Node.JS (server-side usage)

  Add `socket.io-client` to your `package.json` and then:

  ```js
  var socket = require('socket.io-client')('http://localhost');
  socket.on('connect', function(){});
  socket.on('event', function(data){});
  socket.on('disconnect', function(){});
  ```

## API

### IO(url:String, opts:Object):Socket

  Exposed as the `io` namespace in the standalone build, or the result
  of calling `require('socket.io-client')`.

  When called, it creates a new `Manager` for the given URL, and attempts
  to reuse an existing `Manager` for subsequent calls, unless the
  `multiplex` option is passed with `false`.

  The rest of the options are passed to the `Manager` constructor (see below
  for details).

  A `Socket` instance is returned for the namespace specified by the
  pathname in the URL, defaulting to `/`. For example, if the `url` is
  `http://localhost/users`, a transport connection will be established to
  `http://localhost` and a Socket.IO connection will be established to
  `/users`.

### IO#protocol

  Socket.io protocol revision number this client works with.

### IO#Socket

  Reference to the `Socket` constructor.

### IO#Manager

  Reference to the `Manager` constructor.

### IO#Emitter

  Reference to the `Emitter` constructor.

### Manager(url:String, opts:Object)

  A `Manager` represents a connection to a given Socket.IO server. One or
  more `Socket` instances are associated with the manager. The manager
  can be accessed through the `io` property of each `Socket` instance.

  The `opts` are also passed to `engine.io` upon initialization of the
  underlying `Socket`.

  Options:
  - `reconnection` whether to reconnect automatically (`true`)
  - `reconnectionAttempts` (`Infinity`) before giving up
  - `reconnectionDelay` how long to initially wait before attempting a new
    reconnection (`1000`). Affected by +/- `randomizationFactor`,
    for example the default initial delay will be between 500 to 1500ms.
  - `reconnectionDelayMax` maximum amount of time to wait between
    reconnections (`5000`). Each attempt increases the reconnection delay by 2x
    along with a randomization as above
  - `randomizationFactor(`0.5`), 0 <= randomizationFactor <= 1
  - `timeout` connection timeout before a `connect_error`
    and `connect_timeout` events are emitted (`20000`)
  - `autoConnect` by setting this false, you have to call `manager.open`
    whenever you decide it's appropriate

#### Events

  - `connect`. Fired upon a successful connection.
  - `connect_error`. Fired upon a connection error.
    Parameters:
      - `Object` error object
  - `connect_timeout`. Fired upon a connection timeout.
  - `reconnect`. Fired upon a successful reconnection.
    Parameters:
      - `Number` reconnection attempt number
  - `reconnect_attempt`. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.
  - `reconnecting`. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.
    Parameters:
      - `Number` reconnection attempt number
  - `reconnect_error`. Fired upon a reconnection attempt error.
    Parameters:
      - `Object` error object
  - `reconnect_failed`. Fired when couldn't reconnect within `reconnectionAttempts`

The events above are also emitted on the individual sockets that
reconnect that depend on this `Manager`.

### Manager#reconnection(v:Boolean):Manager

  Sets the `reconnection` option, or returns it if no parameters
  are passed.

### Manager#reconnectionAttempts(v:Boolean):Manager

  Sets the `reconectionDelayMax` option, or returns it if no parameters
  are passed.

### Manager#timeout(v:Boolean):Manager

  Sets the `timeout` option, or returns it if no parameters
  are passed.

### Socket

#### Socket#id:String
